        <h3>Desciption of Project</h3>

        <p>
            This projects objective is to create a HTML website 
            using the knowledge I have learned thus far from, The 
            Odin Project. The website utilizes a variety of HTML 
            elements, specifically, showcasing the use and knowledge 
            of, anchors, images, unordered lists , ordered lists, 
            headings, and paragraphs. Keep in mind that I have only 
            learned HTML and not CSS or Javascript at this point in 
            time. This was also good practice and first time making 
            commit messages to Git.</p>
