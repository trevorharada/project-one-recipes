        <h3>Ingredients <em>(8 servings)</em></h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 quart vanilla ice cream</li>
                <li>3 cups crushed cornflakes cereal</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>3 egg whites</li>
                <li>2 quarts oil for frying</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Scoop ice cream into eight 1/2-cup-sized 
                    balls. Place on a baking sheet and freeze 
                    until firm, about 1 hour.</li>
                <li>Combine cornflakes and cinnamon in a 
                    shallow dish. Beat egg whites until foamy 
                    in a separate bowl.</li>
                <li>Roll ice cream balls in egg whites, 
                    then in cornflakes, covering ice cream 
                    completely. Repeat if necessary. Freeze 
                    again until firm, about 3 hours.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large, heavy 
                    saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
                <li>Using a basket or slotted spoon, fry ice 
                    cream balls 1 or 2 at a time in hot oil until 
                    golden, 10 to 15 seconds. Drain quickly on 
                    paper towels and serve immediately.</li>
            </ol>
