Description of project:

This projects objective is to create a HTML website using the knowledge 
I have learned thus far from, The Odin Project. The website utilizes a 
variety of HTML elements, specifically, showcasing the use and knowledge 
of, <a>, <img>, <ul>, <ol>, <h>, and <p>. Keep in mind that I have only 
learned HTML and not CSS or Javascript at this point in time. This is also 
good practice and first time making commit messages to Git.

Reflection:

Building the website in HTML and following the instructions was very easy to 
do. I felt that, The Odin Project, did a good job teaching me what I needed 
to know to be able to do something like this, so I felt prepared. 

I needed a small refresher on how to initally clone the repository from Git to 
my machine. I forgot that when commiting messages to Git that when using the 
command, git commit -m, that you needed to put your commit message in quotation 
marks, resulting in my first few commit messages to have no substance.

The hardest part of this project wasnt the project itself, but figuring out when 
a good point was to commit my changes, as well as the content of my commit messages.
